# mock-insta-visuals

This project was a POC, at the time I was learning how to work with HTML and CSS. The page is basic and static as I did not know JavaScript when I created this project. 

## How to open the page:

- [Github Pages Link](https://fekete-bruno.github.io/mock-insta-visuals/)

- Alternatively, you can download this project to your machine and run index.html on your browser
